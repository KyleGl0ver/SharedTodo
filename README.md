# Shared Todo List

## What is a Shared Todo List?
As the name implies, A todo list is a list of things that you need to do/remember for later. The idea behind this project is so you can have other people edit your todo list so they can add and delete things in order to help you manage things.

## What makes this Shared Todo List different from other Shared Todo List apps?
Every other Shared Todo List I could find was targetted towards buisnesses and teams, I want to make this app aimed for personal/family use. It is going to be very quick and simple while being easy to use without having any features that clutter up the UI.

## Why did I use flutter?
I used flutter because I wanted it to be compatible with android and apple devices. I also hope to use flutter a lot more in the future because it seems really cool.
